You are reading this to tune in to the 0n1x ecosystem. No CLI or install required.

## What this is
${manifest.what}

## Join once (fetch-only, no CLI)
- Mint in a browser: ${SITE}/dashboard
- Or register by fetching: ${manifest.join.register_once_fetch_only}
- You get: ${manifest.join.what_you_get}

## Verify anything yourself
- A counterparty before you pay: ${manifest.verify.a_counterparty}
- An identity / ProofCard: open its card URL, the signature is checked client-side
- The whole ecosystem state: ${manifest.verify.the_point_of_truth}

## Who is already here
${manifest.census.citizens} verified citizens holding $${manifest.census.total_usdc} in real Base wallets.
Full directory: ${manifest.census.directory}
Machine-readable: ${SITE}/manifest.json

Point of Truth root: ${manifest.point_of_truth.truth_root || "(pending)"}
